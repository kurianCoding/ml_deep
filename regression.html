					Functions in machine learning are non linear, and multivariate. If they could be defined diterministically, then they wouldn't always make it to machine learning. That is why we don't focus on finding out the exact definition of such functions. I mean it might exist, but it would be really time counsuming and a pointless academic excercise. </p>
					<p>What we try to do in Machine learning, at least at this stage, is to find simple ways to represent what are essentially complex, multi-variable functions. To do this we need to first see some cases where this approach will work, to know, why it works and where it won't.</p>
					<p>Lets take the case of housing prices, shown below is the housing price against grading of the houses and  the house prices against sqfeet area. Its clear that they depend on both.</p>
					<p>Now in order to use linear regression, we make an assumption, that the target variable is one and that it is linearly dependent on the independent vectors. So instead of finding the actual relation, we  need to just find the slope and y intercept of the line that best fits these points. Such an approximation would fail for example if the points were evenly distributed, as shown below. It would also fail if the points were clumped together as shown below.</p>
